Trend in India, Pakistan and Philippine from Google Search Keywords
==================================================================

### Introduction
Google is the most commonly used search engine in the world across all platforms, “with more than 5.4 billion searches each day and 78,881 searches in 1 second" (Google Search Statistics). Google Trend, also, offers an well-structured information within the limit of 1 - 30 Categories. There are top 10 popular keywords per each category, and lists on each year by each country from 2001 until now. The initial trends per each country are expected to see and capture each historical interests or big events over time.


### Why choose India, Pakistan and Philippine dataset?
The report tried to capture the global trends, however, Global dataset in Google trends does not support China and three Higher internet usage countries in Asia don’t use Google as a primary search engine (Internet Stats & Facts for 2019). Due to these reasons, the report decided to rather look up the regions that have a lower broadband penetration rate. The lower broadband penetration rate will be a great indicator to find out a less compatible market for the search engine, so it will lead to get more prominent results by using the Google search dataset to see those region’s overall trends.

### Conclusion
The hypothesis of the report was finding any changes in trends in each region over time and capturing similarities or differences between three countries over time. Yes, India and Pakistan have a common understanding and culturally bound - both love playing or watching sports games, and like various movies, actors, and actresses in each other’s film. The only difference between these two countries were India has more diversity interests with education or news, Pakistan kept their interests in sports and celebrities. So if anyone interests to promote their services on three countries, India and Pakistan would be an almost the same target audience with these their interests. Philippine, however, has been already got interests abroad since 2014, It might have multiple sources to track the international trends so be aware of their market industries first.
