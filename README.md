Trend in India, Pakistan and Philippine from Google Search Keywords
==================================================================

### Introduction
Google is the most commonly used search engine in the world across all platforms, “with more than 5.4 billion searches each day and 78,881 searches in 1 second" (Google Search Statistics). Google Trend, also, offers an well-structured information within the limit of 1 - 30 Categories. There are top 10 popular keywords per each category, and lists on each year by each country from 2001 until now. The initial trends per each country are expected to see and capture each historical interests or big events over time.


### Why choose India, Pakistan and Philippine dataset?
The report tried to capture the global trends, however, Global dataset in Google trends does not support China and three Higher internet usage countries in Asia don’t use Google as a primary search engine (Internet Stats & Facts for 2019). Due to these reasons, the report decided to rather look up the regions that have a lower broadband penetration rate. The lower broadband penetration rate will be a great indicator to find out a less compatible market for the search engine, so it will lead to get more prominent results by using the Google search dataset to see those region’s overall trends.
